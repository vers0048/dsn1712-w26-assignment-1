    <h2>Our Mission</h2>

We believe that understanding how designers think can help anyone become a better problem solver, whether you're working in technology, education, business, or any other field.</p>

      <p>Our goal is to break down complex ideas into clear, understandable concepts—without the jargon that often makes design feel exclusive or intimidating.</p>

    <h2>About the Structure</h2>
